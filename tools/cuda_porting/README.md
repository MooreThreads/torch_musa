This directory contains scripts and files used to implement CUDA-Porting, which allow cuda kernels could be invoked by torch_musa with little efforts.

### Building Steps of CUDA-Porting
0. Copy files (specified in 'PORT_FILES' in cuda_porting.py) from PyTorch source code to a folder, such as "build/generated_cuda_compatible".
1. Implement CUDA-Porting with specific maps, including:
    - map from general.json
    - map from include.json
    - map from extra.json
    - header file path map 
2. Copy several special files about macros which are generated by cmake when building PyTorch. Through the macro definitions in these files, we can better control the compilation process.
    - MUSAConfig.h
    - cmake_macros.h
    - musa_cmake_macros.h
    - jit_macros.h

### Future work
0. Json files mentioned above are too large. In the future, we will improve the cuda-porting module according to the iteration of **Musify**.
