    r"""Accept callables (functions or :class:`nn.Module<torch.nn.Module>`\ s) and returns graphed
      versions.

    Each graphed callable's forward pass runs its source callable's
    forward MUSA work as a MUSA graph inside a single autograd node.

    The graphed callable's forward pass also appends
    a backward node to the autograd graph. During backward, this node runs the
    callable's backward work as a MUSA graph.

    Therefore, each graphed callable should be a drop-in replacement for its source callable
    in an autograd-enabled training loop.

    See :ref:`Partial-network capture<partial-network-capture>` for detailed use and constraints.

    If you pass a tuple of several callables, their captures will use the same memory pool.
    See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>` for when this is appropriate.

    Arguments:
        callables (torch.nn.Module or Python function, or tuple of these): Callable or callables
          to graph.See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>` for when passing a
          tuple of callablesis appropriate.  If you pass a tuple of callables, their order in the
          tuple must be the same order they'll run in the live workload.
        sample_args (tuple of Tensors, or tuple of tuples of Tensors): Samples args for
          each callable.If a single callable was passed, ``sample_args`` must be a single
            tuple of argument Tensors.If a tuple of callables was passed, ``sample_args``
            must be tuple of tuples of argument Tensors.
        num_warmup_iters (int): The number of warmup iterations. Currently,
          ``DataDistributedParallel`` needs 11 iterations for warm up. Default: ``3``.
        allow_unused_input (bool): If False, specifying inputs that were not used when computing
          outputs (and therefore their grad is always zero) is an error. Defaults to False.

    .. note::
        The ``requires_grad`` state of each Tensor in ``sample_args`` must match the state
        that's expected for the corresponding real input in the training loop.
